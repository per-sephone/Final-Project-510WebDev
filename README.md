Welcome to my personal portfolio website for CS510- Intro to Web Development. 
To view this project, go to https://per-sephone.github.io/Final-Project-510WebDev/

In this project we are required to write a personal, professional website entirely from scratch.
We must make a nav bar, an about me section, a previous work section, a project section that
contains at least 2 projects, and a contact form written from scratch. We must also integrate
javascript or a javascript library into our website. 

For this project I used bootstrap, bootstrap icons, and CSS flexbox. I used fontspace.com for my
fonts. They have free fonts for both personal and commercial use. I utilized the WAVE accessibility
extension and lighthouse which is part of dev tools. My website was built mobile-first and has
multiple media queries to help the site adjust with different screen sizes. With smaller sizes
the nav bar and font sizes are smaller. With a larger screen, the layout changes and the sizes
of photographs and text are larger, as well as a larger nav bar. For anyone who has low vision
I recommend using my website with a larger screen so as to utilize the larger font sizes and 
nav bar. 

I implemented several different ideas with javascript. The first thing I
implemented was a way to check if my contact form is filled out properly before sending.
A user must include an email address and a message, and will receive a pop-up message if
they do not fill out the form properly. I used EmailJS to have my contact form sent to my
email address. This service is super easy to use if you do not have a backend. It does 
limit how many emails you can receive, so not recommended for anyone who might get
a large number of emails from their website. The second idea I implemented with Javascript
is a way for the user to change the color theme of my website. As many programmers know
there is usually a dark theme and a light theme for most websites and IDEs. I personally
prefer a dark theme, however my website does contain a button at the bottom that allows the
user to choose which color scheme they prefer. I made the button a toggle button, so that
the same button can toggle back and forth between dark and light theme. 

This repository also contains a journal which chronicles the building of this website.
